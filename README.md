## Overview of Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to merge student test score data with school budget data in order to better visualize and identify correlations between students test scores and their related school budgets.

## Results
- The district summary has slightly lower passing percentages with the removal of both test and reading scores for 9th grade Thomas High School students. This means that 9th grade students at Thomas High School on average score slightly higher than their peers in the district.
- The school summary has slightly higher passing percentages with the removal of both test and reading scores for 9th grade Thomas High School students. This is due to the fact that the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders at Thomas High School on average scored considerably higher than their 9th grade peers.

- Thomas High School is a Charter school and Charter schools have very high passing percentages for reading and math, so much so that removing the scores of Thomas 9th graders will slightly increase the overall average passing percentages of Charter schools.
- Thomas High School is a relatively small school with 1,635 students. At this student size range, average passing percentages are extremely high. Thus, removing the scores of Thomas 9th graders will slightly increase the overall average passing percentage in this student range.
- Thomas High School's total budget is at $1,043,130.00, which is at the lower range among all schools, although budget per student is on the higher range. Schools in this budget range have comparable passing percentages to the passing percentages of Thomas 9th graders. Thus, the overall average passing percentages will not be affected much by the removal of their scores.
## Summary
With the removal of test scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School, average passing reading percentages at the district level are slightly decreased. In addition, Thomas 9th graders also pass math at slightly lower percentages than the district average. Surprisingly, average reading & math scores are higher than the district average.
